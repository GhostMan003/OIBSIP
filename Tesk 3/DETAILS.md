Task 3: ATM INTERFACE SYSTEM

Description:

We have all come across ATMs in our cities, and they are built on Java. This complex project consists of
15 different classes and is a GUI-based application. When the system starts, the user is
entered with the card number and pin. On entering the details successfully, ATM functionalities
are unlocked. The project allows for the following operations:
1. Login (enter the card number PIN and choose the bank name).
2. Signup (If the user doesn't have an ATM card and PIN, then create a new account, fill in all the details, and get the card number with a computer-generated PIN).
3. Click the Exit button to exit the program.
4. Deposit.
5. Withdrawal.
6. Change the PIN.
7. Fast cash withdrawal
8. E-Statement.
9. Balance check.
10. Press the exit button to exit the ATM.

The technology used in this project is:

1. Java Swing
2. Java AWT
3. Java SQL
4. MYSQL server
