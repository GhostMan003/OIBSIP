Task 2: NUMBER GUESSING GAME

Description:

The fun and easy project "Guess the Number" is a short Java project that allows the user to
Guess the number generated by the computer, which involves the following steps:
1. The system generates a random number from a range of 1 to 100.
2. The user is prompted to enter their given number in a displayed empty box.
3. The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guessed number or if it is
higher or lower than the generated number.
4. The game continues with the user guessing the number.
5. Here are five rounds and ten attempts to guess the number.
6. Based on the number of attempts, you will see your score at the game's end.
7. If you are not able to guess the number on the given attempts, you will start again.

The technology used in this project is:

1. Java Swing
2. Java AWT

How the program works:

Starting_Interface > Round 1 > Round 2 > Round 3 > Round 4 > Round 5 > (back to) Starting_Interface.
